# c64-Butterfly

In October 2010 I was bored and desided to write a small graphical demo in C64 Basic.
I even did a Youtube video about this program and promised a assembler version of it.
The assmebler version i never got around to. Recently I have done some retro programming
again now mainly in CC65 and thought to myself that portin my old Basic demo should be
easy. It is , it's not any beatiful C-source but is more or less very straightforward.

So here comes...
The original Butterfly Basic program 
straightforward implementation in C.
It runs allot faster then the old Basic Demo did.

Compile to PRG with included Makefile
Example:
$ make

The Youtube video is still availible at:
